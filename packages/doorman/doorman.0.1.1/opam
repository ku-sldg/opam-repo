  "A 'doorman' service that can be used to expose a service to the internet"
description: """
A 'doorman' service that can be used to expose a service to the internet. Be careful with this, as if you are not careful arbitrary control of your system could be exposed to the internet.
 In particular, NEVER expose a service that allows arbitrary code execution, such as a shell or REPL, to the internet without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place."""
